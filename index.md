My name is Lifang Cheng and I received my Masters in Water Engineering and Water Management from insa-toulouse in 2024 and I also have a Masters in Bioengineering. I am looking for a Phd position.

As a master's student at the INSA-Toulouse, I specialised in water engineering and management and completed courses and topics directly related to the field of wastewater treatment, fluids, soil and solid waste, such as fluid dynamics, wastewater treatment engineering, and drinking water production engineering. 

I am currently learning python, machine learning etc. and I have a keen interest in environmental, biological and chemical related modelling projects.
